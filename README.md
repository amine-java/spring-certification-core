## Preparing for the Spring Core Professional Certification - Pivotal 

As I am preparing for the Spring Core Professional Certification, I decided to create this project in order to practice essential Spring 
concepts with some examples and explanations. 

The project will be divided in packages (lesson1, lesson2 and so on..) each package will be 
about a specific topic such as 'difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext' - 'Bean Lifecycle' - 'i18n in Spring' and so on..
